SHAPE OF YOU.

My "SHAPE OF YOU" application is a fitness application that will provide its users with multiple functionalities such as:
-signup and login for each user
-being able to type in their weight, height and age to sucessfully calculate the right amount of callories intake per day 
-a callorie counter that will keep track of how much you eat in a day. The user will be able to add certain types of foods, delete them or edit them. Eventualy, when multiple foods are added , the user will be able to see all of the foods in one place.
-"eat and drink what you have in your fridge", here , the user will be able to type in all the ingredients they have at home, and suggestions of what they could eat or drink will appear on the screen.
-add favourite recipes , delete or update them
-offline support - persist data on the local storage
-online support -> synchronize date to/from a remote location
 
 
 The application will be developed on Android and it will contain a persistent database with all the necessary entities.
 
 Why did I approach this theme?
   Even though there are a lot of fitness applications on the market, I am planning to develop my own app, so I can add whatever functionalities I believe are useful for me.
